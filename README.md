- 👋 Hi, I’m @AGBaltazar
-   I'm a sponge with knowledge of JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, and some Python!
- 🌱 As days come and go, I am trying to absorb as much Python and JavaScript knowledge as possible!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications big or small!
- 📫 You can reach me at algc150@gmail.com
